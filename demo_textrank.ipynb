BACKGROUND \\n1.1  The threat of potential acts of unlawful interference against civil aviation continues to \\nmanifest itself due to the presence of active terrorist groups and events in the African region. The above-\\nmentioned threats co-exist with the recorded increase in air transport passenger flows. Furthermore, the \\nUniversal Security Audit Programme Continuous Monitoring Approach (USAP-CMA) results indicate \\nthat progress has been achieved in the last three years in raising the level of effective implementation of \\nICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) but more needs to be done to realize the targets \\nestablished in the Global Aviation Security Plan (GASeP) and the associated regional plans. Increasingly \\ncomplex current and emerging threats such as cyber security, landside security and insider threat, call for \\na coordinated and cohesive approach to mitigate the consequences. \\n1.2  Furthermore,  at  the  international  level,  and  as  part  of  the  coordination  with  the \\nUnited Nations  Security Council  (UNSC)  Global  Counter-Terrorism  Strategy,  ICAO’s  leadership  in \\ntraveller identification is recognized to have made a significant contribution to enhancing air transport \\nfacilitation, by using identification tools, as described in the ICAO Traveller Identification Programme \\n(ICAO TRIP) Strategy, to ensure robust border control management. Controls on issuance of identity \\npapers and travel documents, and measures for preventing counterfeiting, forgery or fraudulent use of \\nidentity papers and travel documents are detailed in ICAO Standards and Specifications related to \\nMachine Readable Travel Documents (MRTDs) issuance. Furthermore ICAO is making available to \\nStates a powerful and useful inspection tool, the ICAO Public Key Directory (PKD) which allows them to \\nauthenticate and verify ePassports at their borders. In that context, ICAO actively supports UNSC \\nresolutions 2178 (2014), 2309 (2016), 2368 (2017) and 2396 (2017) intended to stem the flow of foreign \\nterrorist fighters (FTFs). UNSC resolution 2396 (2017) mandated the use, by Member States, of Advance \\nPassenger Information (API) (an Annex 9 Standard, mandatory since 23 February 2018), as well as the \\ndevelopment of the capability to collect, process and analyse, in furtherance of ICAO standards and \\nrecommended practices, passenger name record (PNR) data. The resolution also urges ICAO to work with \\nits Member States to establish a standard for the collection, use, processing and protection of PNR data. \\nWork on this is currently in progress. \\n1.3  The Comprehensive Regional Implementation Plan for Aviation Security and Facilitation \\nin Africa (AFI SECFAL Plan) is an ICAO Programme intended to assist African States to enhance \\naviation security and facilitation, coordinate and align all capacity-building efforts and resolve systemic \\ndeficiencies in aviation security and facilitation in a sustainable manner. \\n1.4  The implementation of the AFI SECFAL Plan is anchored on a three-phase (short-, \\nmedium-  and  long-term)  work  programme  approved  by  the  Plan’s  Steering  Committee  (SC).  The \\ncompletion of the short term phase of the Plan on 31 December 2017 has had a positive impact on the \\neffective  implementation  of  State  aviation  security  oversight  systems,  and  compliance  with \\nAnnex 17 ― Security Standards and Recommended Practices and the Annex 9 ― Facilitation provisions \\nthat support both aviation security and border security objectives. \\n2.  DISCUSSION \\n2.1  Since its inception in 2015 in Maputo, Mozambique, the Plan has made significant \\nprogress under the guidance of the Steering Committee (SC) with the assistance of the ICAO Secretariat. \\nThe  AFI  SECFAL  Plan  Steering  Committee  has,  so  far,  held  eight  meetings  with  the \\nEighth Steering Committee meeting held in Uganda in May 2019. \\n - 3 - A40-WP/63 \\nEX/30 \\n \\n \\n2.2  The short-term phase of the Plan ended on 31 December 2017 having largely achieved \\nthe planned activities and goals, and provided a good platform for implementation of the medium- and \\nlong-term  phases  (2018-2020  and  2021-2023  respectively).  Collaboration  and  awareness  between \\ninternational and regional organizations including the African Union Commission (AUC), African Civil \\nAviation Commission (AFCAC), European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), European Union (EU), \\nUN Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED), Airports Council International (ACI), \\nInternational Air Transport Association (IATA), African Airlines Association (AFRAA), Regional Safety \\nOversight Organizations (RSOOs), World Customs Organization (WCO), International Organization for \\nMigration  (IOM),  and  the  International  Criminal  Police  Organization  (INTERPOL),  has  been \\nstrengthened in terms of work in this area. The AFI SECFAL Plan Fund, established in 2017, has \\nreceived voluntary financial contributions from Belgium, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Uganda and in-kind \\ncontributions through the provision of experts from many States in the Region and outside the Region. \\n2.3  In order to have a harmonized approach to the delivery of the ICAO Strategic Objectives, \\nthe AFI SECFAL Plan work programme, the Windhoek Declaration and Targets for aviation security and \\nfacilitation in Africa and the Africa and Middle East Aviation Security Roadmap have all been aligned \\nwith the GASeP. \\n2.4  The Windhoek Declaration and Targets for Aviation Security and Facilitation in Africa \\nwere endorsed by the African Union (AU) Summit in July 2017 (Appendix A), thereby reinforcing the \\nmuch needed political commitment to enhance compliance with the relevant ICAO SARPs relating to \\naviation security and facilitation. \\n2.5  The AFI Regional Aviation Security and Facilitation Group (RASFALG-AFI), under the \\nauspices of AFCAC, continues to provide technical support to the AFI SECFAL Plan to help implement \\nand monitor the aligned targets. The AFI Region Collaborative Experts Scheme (CES) has also been \\nestablished as a vehicle for delivering assistance to States, supporting the implementation of approved \\nPlan projects while making full use of the aviation security and facilitation expertise available in Africa. \\n2.6  In  the  spirit  of  inter-regional  cooperation,  the  Africa  and  Middle  East  Regional \\nMinisterial Conference held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, from 22 to 24 August 2017, endorsed the \\nRoadmap on Aviation Security aligned with the GASeP. The AFI SECFAL Plan has also supported the \\nestablishment of the Regional Aviation Security and Facilitation Group in the ICAO Middle East Region \\nin line with Council recognition of the importance of establishing regional mechanisms to address \\naviation security and facilitation challenges. \\n2.7  A project-based approach has been established for the AFI SECFAL Plan, with specific \\nprojects being developed and implemented for priority States founded on a comprehensive analysis of the \\nAFI Region USAP-CMA results and State mission reports to determine the common areas of deficiencies, \\nneeds and proposed remedial measures to address the challenges in a sustainable manner. \\n2.8  In order to assist AFI States to implement the ICAO TRIP strategy, the AFI SECFAL \\nPlan has enhanced awareness of the benefits of PKD membership, API implementation and PNR data in \\nsupport of the dedicated roadmap developed highlighting notably the corresponding Annex 9 Standards, \\nwhich are audited under the USAP-CMA (Appendix B). \\n2.9  In support of the AUC initiative for the AU Pan African ePassport the AFI SECFAL Plan \\nis providing assistance to AFI States towards the development of an African e-passport compliant with \\n A40-WP/63  - 4 -\\nEX/30 \\n \\n \\nthe ICAO Standards and Specifications on eMRTDs, aiming at facilitating free movement of persons on \\nthe African Continent. \\n2.10  It  is  anticipated  that  the  ongoing  resource  mobilization  strategy,  coupled  with  the \\ncampaign by the ICAO Council and ICAO Secretariat, will culminate in increased resources to effectively \\nimplement the Plan through voluntary contributions from States and donor partners. Additionally, it is \\nconsidered imperative that the Plan’s implementation be supported and funded under the regular budget to \\nensure a sustainable funding mechanism. \\n2.11  Although  the  AFI  SECFAL  Plan  has  helped  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  the \\neffective implementation of the Critical Elements (CEs) of aviation security oversight systems for the \\nAfrican States, significant challenges of qualified aviation security personnel, adequate infrastructure, \\nfinancial resources and robust State commitment still remain in attaining the regional and GASeP targets. \\n2.12  In considering the importance of the AFI SECFAL Plan in enhancing aviation security \\nand facilitation in Africa in a sustainable manner, proposed updates to Assembly Resolution A39-38 are \\nshown in Appendix C. \\n2.13  A  summary  of  the  specific  results  delivered  by  the  AFI  SECFAL  Plan  since  the \\n39th Assembly are shown in Appendix D. \\n3.  CONCLUSION \\n3.1  The implementation of the AFI SECFAL Plan is steadily progressing and has, to an \\nextent,  made  an  impact  on  compliance  with  Annex  17  ―  Security  SARPs  and  with \\nAnnex 9 ― Facilitation provisions that support both border management and border security objectives. \\nThe endorsement of the Windhoek Declaration and Targets by the African Union Summit signifies \\nincreased political commitment that needs to be transformed into tangible measures to enhance effective \\nimplementation of State aviation security oversight systems. It is evident that with a sustainable funding \\nmechanism under the ICAO Regular budget, State commitment and strong stakeholder partnerships, the \\nobjectives of the Plan can be achieved including realization of the regional and GASeP targets while \\nensuring  that  AFI  States  are  complying  with  the  UNSC  resolutions  2178  (2014),  2309  (2016), \\n2368 (2017) and 2396 (2017). \\n— — — — — — — — \\n \\n  \\n   \\nA40-WP/63 \\nEX/30 \\nAppendix A1 \\n \\nAPPENDIX A   \\n \\nAFRICAN UNION  UNION AFRICAINE \\n \\n \\nUNIÃO AFRICANA \\n \\nP.

       "'The threat of potential acts of unlawful interference against civil aviation continues to manifest itself due to the presence of active terrorist groups and events in the African region. The above- mentioned threats co-exist with the recorded increase in air transport passenger flows. Furthermore, the Universal Security Audit Programme Continuous Monitoring Approach (USAP-CMA) results indicate that progress has been achieved in the last three years in raising the level of effective implementation of ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) but more needs to be done to realize the targets established in the Global Aviation Security Plan (GASeP) and the associated regional plans. Increasingly complex current and emerging threats such as cyber security, landside security and insider threat, call for a coordinated and cohesive approach to mitigate the consequences. Furthermore, at the international level, and as part of the coordination with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, ICAO’s leadership in traveller identification is recognized to have made a significant contribution to enhancing air transport facilitation, by using identification tools, as described in the ICAO Traveller Identification Programme (ICAO TRIP) Strategy, to ensure robust border control management. Controls on issuance of identity papers and travel documents, and measures for preventing counterfeiting, forgery or fraudulent use of identity papers and travel documents are detailed in ICAO Standards and Specifications related to Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTDs) issuance. Furthermore ICAO is making available to States a powerful and useful inspection tool, the ICAO Public Key Directory (PKD) which allows them to authenticate and verify ePassports at their borders. In that context, ICAO actively supports UNSC resolutions 2178 (2014), 2309 (2016), 2368 (2017) and 2396 (2017) intended to stem the flow of foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs). UNSC resolution 2396 (2017) mandated the use, by Member States, of Advance Passenger Information (API) (an Annex 9 Standard, mandatory since 23 February 2018), as well as the development of the capability to collect, process and analyse, in furtherance of ICAO standards and recommended practices, passenger name record (PNR) data. The resolution also urges ICAO to work with its Member States to establish a standard for the collection, use, processing and protection of PNR data. Work on this is currently in progress. The Comprehensive Regional Implementation Plan for Aviation Security and Facilitation in Africa (AFI SECFAL Plan) is an ICAO Programme intended to assist African States to enhance aviation security and facilitation, coordinate and align all capacity-building efforts and resolve systemic deficiencies in aviation security and facilitation in a sustainable manner. The implementation of the AFI SECFAL Plan is anchored on a three-phase (short-, medium- and long-term) work programme approved by the Plan’s Steering Committee (SC). The completion of the short term phase of the Plan on 31 December 2017 has had a positive impact on the effective implementation of State aviation security oversight systems, and compliance with Annex 17 ― Security Standards and Recommended Practices and the Annex 9 ― Facilitation provisions that support both aviation security and border security objectives. Since its inception in 2015 in Maputo, Mozambique, the Plan has made significant progress under the guidance of the Steering Committee (SC) with the assistance of the ICAO Secretariat. The AFI SECFAL Plan Steering Committee has, so far, held eight meetings with the Eighth Steering Committee meeting held in Uganda in May 2019. The short-term phase of the Plan ended on 31 December 2017 having largely achieved the planned activities and goals, and provided a good platform for implementation of the medium- and long-term phases (2018-2020 and 2021-2023 respectively). Collaboration and awareness between international and regional organizations including the African Union Commission (AUC), African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), European Union (EU), UN Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED), Airports Council International (ACI), International Air Transport Association (IATA), African Airlines Association (AFRAA), Regional Safety Oversight Organizations (RSOOs), World Customs Organization (WCO), International Organization for Migration (IOM), and the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), has been strengthened in terms of work in this area. The AFI SECFAL Plan Fund, established in 2017, has received voluntary financial contributions from Belgium, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Uganda and in-kind contributions through the provision of experts from many States in the Region and outside the Region. In order to have a harmonized approach to the delivery of the ICAO Strategic Objectives, the AFI SECFAL Plan work programme, the Windhoek Declaration and Targets for aviation security and facilitation in Africa and the Africa and Middle East Aviation Security Roadmap have all been aligned with the GASeP. The Windhoek Declaration and Targets for Aviation Security and Facilitation in Africa were endorsed by the African Union (AU) Summit in July 2017 (Appendix A), thereby reinforcing the much needed political commitment to enhance compliance with the relevant ICAO SARPs relating to aviation security and facilitation. The AFI Regional Aviation Security and Facilitation Group (RASFALG-AFI), under the auspices of AFCAC, continues to provide technical support to the AFI SECFAL Plan to help implement and monitor the aligned targets. The AFI Region Collaborative Experts Scheme (CES) has also been established as a vehicle for delivering assistance to States, supporting the implementation of approved Plan projects while making full use of the aviation security and facilitation expertise available in Africa. In the spirit of inter-regional cooperation, the Africa and Middle East Regional Ministerial Conference held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, from 22 to 24 August 2017, endorsed the Roadmap on Aviation Security aligned with the GASeP. The AFI SECFAL Plan has also supported the establishment of the Regional Aviation Security and Facilitation Group in the ICAO Middle East Region in line with Council recognition of the importance of establishing regional mechanisms to address aviation security and facilitation challenges. A project-based approach has been established for the AFI SECFAL Plan, with specific projects being developed and implemented for priority States founded on a comprehensive analysis of the AFI Region USAP-CMA results and State mission reports to determine the common areas of deficiencies, needs and proposed remedial measures to address the challenges in a sustainable manner. In order to assist AFI States to implement the ICAO TRIP strategy, the AFI SECFAL Plan has enhanced awareness of the benefits of PKD membership, API implementation and PNR data in support of the dedicated roadmap developed highlighting notably the corresponding Annex 9 Standards, which are audited under the USAP-CMA (Appendix B). In support of the AUC initiative for the AU Pan African ePassport the AFI SECFAL Plan is providing assistance to AFI States towards the development of an African e-passport compliant with the ICAO Standards and Specifications on eMRTDs, aiming at facilitating free movement of persons on the African Continent. It is anticipated that the ongoing resource mobilization strategy, coupled with the campaign by the ICAO Council and ICAO Secretariat, will culminate in increased resources to effectively implement the Plan through voluntary contributions from States and donor partners. Additionally, it is considered imperative that the Plan’s implementation be supported and funded under the regular budget to ensure a sustainable funding mechanism. Although the AFI SECFAL Plan has helped contribute to the improvement of the effective implementation of the Critical Elements (CEs) of aviation security oversight systems for the African States, significant challenges of qualified aviation security personnel, adequate infrastructure, financial resources and robust State commitment still remain in attaining the regional and GASeP targets. In considering the importance of the AFI SECFAL Plan in enhancing aviation security and facilitation in Africa in a sustainable manner, proposed updates to Assembly Resolution A39-38 are shown in Appendix C. A summary of the specific results delivered by the AFI SECFAL Plan since the 39th Assembly are shown in Appendix D. The implementation of the AFI SECFAL Plan is steadily progressing and has, to an extent, made an impact on compliance with Annex 17 ― Security SARPs and with Annex 9 ― Facilitation provisions that support both border management and border security objectives. The endorsement of the Windhoek Declaration and Targets by the African Union Summit signifies increased political commitment that needs to be transformed into tangible measures to enhance effective implementation of State aviation security oversight systems. It is evident that with a sustainable funding mechanism under the ICAO Regular budget, State commitment and strong stakeholder partnerships, the objectives of the Plan can be achieved including realization of the regional and GASeP targets while ensuring that AFI States are complying with the UNSC resolutions 2178 (2014), 2309 (2016), 2368 (2017) and 2396 (2017).'"
