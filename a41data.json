The technical solution ensures aircraft remain safely positioned at a steady altitude throughout \u201cpaired\u201d flight. The technology has shown it can drive at least a 5 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions per flight.

specific concepts, extended minimum crew operations (eMCO) and single pilot operations (SiPO), are currently being considered for implementation in the near and mid-term future. Both concepts would reduce the current number of required pilots present in the flight deck during operations to a single pilot and raise great concern due to significant new risks with unknown consequences. It is imperative that any future evolution of this benchmark improves upon and does not degrade the safety and security level in any area. Where eMCO are concerned, the concept lacks both maturity and statistical proof of increased safety with the proposed enabling technology. Proponents of eMCO have suggested this concept will address problems around pilot fatigue by providing more opportunities for pilots to rest during flight. Pilot fatigue management is a much wider concept than providing pilots more opportunities to rest during the flight. Adequate pilot fatigue management starts with a scientific-based fatigue risk management system (FRMS) established by the operator in collaboration with the pilot group. With a fully functional and properly established FRMS, the operator will have the data to better understand how fatigue is impacting the crews and take the necessary measures to address it. Lack of crew interaction and coordination would create new hazards in pilot training that need to be carefully evaluated before any kind of reduction in crew composition is seriously considered. Additionally, further development and increased reliance on automation should have the goal of enhancing flight safety, as has been done during more than one hundred years of aviation. While progress continues to be made using algorithms that produce an automated response in lieu of pilot input, the safety of those conceptual designs has not been proven to be safer than two well trained, well rested, fully qualified pilots in the flight deck. It is essential to fully address these risks and safety shortfalls before the industry accepts changes to the Standards, which have built the safest transportation system in history.", "The Assembly is invited to: a) carefully examine whether it is appropriate for ICAO to commit any work or resources towards development of a concept of operations (CONOPS) for eMCO.

ICAO decision to commit work or resources in the area; b) ensure that current ICAO Standards regarding fatigue management are implemented in an effective and efficient way worldwide to obtain the necessary data about crew fatigue in air operations before any reduction in the number of pilots in the flight deck is considered; c) promote a positive safety culture worldwide considering cultural differences, with a special emphasis on sound reporting cultures before any change in current ICAO Standards in aircraft certification and aircraft operations are modified to accommodate reduced

and the maintenance and operation of these services in the medium and long terms have been assessed and it was concluded that those costs were much lower than conventional technology costs and that Colombia should stand ready to aid and assist States with this important acquired knowledge which would constitute a challenge for the Region\u2019s States in implementing this technology.", "In the last two years, it has completely repowered eight secondary radars, which has entailed the installation of eight integrated dual ADS-B receivers, additional to the independent ADS-B system currently in place at Pisco.", "Argentina: ANAC has approved the draft air traffic surveillance system modernization plan, which provides for the technological upgrading of 22 INVAP-manufactured secondary radars currently operating in Mode S and ADS-B, replacement of A/C/S primary and secondary radars with ADS-B and a meteorological channel for the terminal at Baires, Cordoba and Mendoza, installation of two new Mode A/C/S and ADS-B secondary radars in the Comodoro Rivadavia FIR and five ADS-B stations in order to broaden aeronautical surveillance coverage.", "In the near future, this technology is likely to replace secondary radars, which have provided excellent surveillance service for a long time, but new technologies and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) now in place provide a better service at a significantly lower infrastructure cost.", "The evaluation noted that most of these aircraft flew on approved routes to the USA, which meant that ADS-B installation was mandatory in order to retain those routes.", "As a result, it was proposed mainly that ADS-B hardware be installed and it was concluded that a total of 14 ADS-B stations were required.", "In conclusion, the cost-benefit analysis is much more favourable than that of the operation and maintenance of primary and secondary radar systems, but it must be explained that an ADS-B system relies on the satellite constellations that provide GPS location of aircraft and it must therefore be regarded for the time being as alternate and complementary to secondary SSR Mode S radars, which must continue to be used

accompanied by up-to-date training and certification practices that ensure validity of those competencies.", "Moreover, the lack of worldwide standardization occasionally hinders States\u2019 efforts to develop ATCO training and certification and causes differences in the issuance and validation of licences from one State to another, the situation will become even more complicated in future, owing to independent rather than systemic implementation of capabilities by States.", "In view of the advantages of cooperation and joint use of existing training resources at the world level in order to meet the region\u2019s emerging ATM needs, it is suggested that recourse be had to technical\u2013academic collaboration between States and their specialized bodies in those fields, which would permit

In the value chain, information systems and the collection of data and the consolidation of these data into a knowledge structure provide the safety authorities with a level of understanding that facilitates decision-making on risks in the NAS. This value chain that connects the entities in an NAS is known as the network and, when this network is a dominant component in the design of more specific data exchange, it is referred to as network centric. The complexity of the NAS and the adoption of SARPs require radical changes in the regulations, organization, functions and culture of States, a process that is not simple and, what is more, is slow. These structural obstacles affect the effective action of the CAA with respect to operational risk management, causing the decision-making process to be reactive and undermining proactive action. Additionally, the data structure is another component that is in need of updating, a change that, if carried out synchronously and in sequence with the updating of the organizational, functional and cultural structures, leads to additional delay in the implementation of the SSP. However, asynchronous development between regulatory adaptation and the design of data structures can expedite SSP oversight capability.
